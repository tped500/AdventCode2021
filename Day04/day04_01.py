"""
Bingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers.
Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is marked on all boards on which it appears.
(Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in any row or any column of a board are marked, that board wins.
(Diagonals don't count.)

The submarine has a bingo subsystem to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass the time.
It automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input)
